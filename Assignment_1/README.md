I put in a unit tester so that I could easily see where I go wrong with my implementations. It would be told clear that something was wrong because
of the stack trace for the unit test. I looked up the concepts of a* to start. My edits are going to be heavily commented.

I know that this what I'm about to say isn't about the assignment, but the netflix series "All of us are dead" is really good and I reccomend it.
